1. the alignment score and the percentage of identical amino acids for each comparison

(1)human gene and mouse gene
    alignment score: 1091
    percentage of identical amino acids: 89.63963963963964%
    distance: 23
(2)human gene and random gene
    alignment score: -250
    percentage of identical amino acids: 5.405405405405405%
    distance: 210
(3)mouse gene and random gene
    alignment score: -250
    percentage of identical amino acids: 5.855855855855852%
    distance: 209

2. what biological, or evolutionary, interpretation you think we can make from these data

The alignment score of the sequence between human gene and mouse gene is much bigger than both of them between the random gene.
And the percentage of identical amino acids between the human and mouse gene is quite large. While the random gene with them are even negative.
What's more, the distance of different genes between the human and mouse gene is very small. While the random gene with them are large.
In conclusion, we can say that human and mouse are closely related in evolutionary terms.
