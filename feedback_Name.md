My original work was not so good. Many mistakes have taken place because of my carelessness and incorrect use of the "For your portfolio" part. And sometimes I even skipped the question so that I got zero in some items.
To solve these problems, I check my code with the formative assessment one by one and correct the mistakes.
(The contents within the double quotation marks are what the teacher said I didn't finish very good. And I take actions to better finish them)

In week 4: (1)"It contains content that is different from the template file" —— I make some random changes
                  (2)"Introductions.txt has been edited by the student" —— I think I did some editions in the past, but to make it more clear, I do more changes
                  (3)"Commit messages for Week 4 are informative" —— Originally, I uploaded it through the way I was taught in class, but now I found it more convenient to directly upload it
                 
In week 5: (1)"Pseudocode has been used and the code is well documented" —— I thought it too easy so there was no need to write the pseudocode in the past, but when rereading the Practical 5, I think the meaning of this task is to help us cultivate the habit of writing the pseudocode, which is useful in the future.
                  (2)"To take any random number between 0 to 50" —— This is my initial understanding of the code. After reading the formative assessment and the code again, I find the description that selects a random number between 1 and 100 until a number less than 50 is selected, which is then printed is more proper.
                  (3)"Pseudocode doesn't explain anything that isn't already explained by the code itself" —— To be honest, I finished this practice in a hurry, therefore, I didn't pay much attention to the pseudocode. Now, I try to rewrite them.
                  (4)"135 infections" —— I think the question was not so clear in the Practical 5. So I finally understand it and revise the code according to the feedback.

In week 6: (1)"this code doesn't run and also doesn't look finished at all" —— Well, that's so embarrassed, I find I misuploaded the code. The file I uploaded was a draft. So I upload the right code now.
                  (2)"sorts list of average exon length numerically" —— And I also skipped one request to sort the list, so I add it.
